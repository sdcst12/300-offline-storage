## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment 300 Offline Storage (Total Marks 5)

Objectives:
* Explore methods of offline storage
* Choose an appropriate method of storing offline data
* Explain the difference between volatile and persistent memory

All of the values that we store in Python program variables are examples of what we call **volatile** memory.  This is memory that disappears when the program stops running or the computer powers down.  Sometimes, we would like values to be retained even if we turn the computer off.  We need to make use of non-volatile storage by writing it somewhere to a hard drive that exists somewhere, either on your local computer or a remote server somewhere else.  We sometimes call this memory **persistent** memory.  One of the problems with persistent memory is that it can be changed.  To address this, one technology that has developed over the last 15 years is the **blockchain**, for accurate and permanent records that can't be tampered with.  The blockchain technology is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.

Think of the following types of data and decide which ones should be volatile or persistent:
* your password to access your email
* the password you typed in to access your email
* your score in an arcade game
* your health / hp in a computer game
* the money that is stored in your bank account

We will be exploring some of the methods involved in non-volatile memory:
1. Reading/writing to files
2. Reading/writing to databases
3. Searching databases

Today, we will look at working with reading data from files.
